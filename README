A serialization strategy for the memcached-session-manager that uses Javolution (http://javolution.org/).

It's implemented using reflection to read/write field values from/to POJOs.

Notable features:
- Support of cyclic dependencies / associations
- Support of private classes and classes without a default constructor (see additional note below)


To support serialization of private classes and classes without a default constructor it
uses Sun's ReflectionFactory (sun.reflect.ReflectionFactory), therefore it's just bound to Sun
JVMs (just drop a note and it will be made configurable).


= How to build =
Install buildr on top of jruby, this is described at http://buildr.apache.org/installing.html.

For building just run 
$ buildr 
(this executes both `buildr compile` and `buildr test`).

For more on building with buildr see http://buildr.apache.org/quick_start.html
